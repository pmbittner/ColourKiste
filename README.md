# SPL2018.Project.18 - ColourKiste

A small image editing application, designed for pixel-precise operations similar to Microsoft Paint.

## TODO

- Make work piece resizable
- Make Tools have custom UI (e.g., for pencil thickness)
- remember when we saved so that we can avoid the prompt for saving when we actually did not do anything
